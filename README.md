# Inventory Sync
One of my first Go scripts used to sync a friend's zen cart inventory with the inventory of a local distributor via online csv. The code is about 2+ years old and spent most of it's life in a pivate repo pack until I recently decided to make it public. Maybe one day I'll refactor it if I have time.
